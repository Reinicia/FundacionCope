= Our Philosophy =

Like all of our plugins, we strive to create code the runs efficiently and without bugs. We feel well-written plugins are few and far between. While there are plenty of plugins that look nice, far too many of those plugins, including the "cool shiny ones" have way to many hidden problems. We have found that over 90% of the plugins available on the WordPress plugin directory generate dozens, if not hundreds, of warnings and errors when we turn off the "hide all the problems" settings in PHP.

These hidden problems impact memory usage, fill up disk space, and reduce performance via the typical default logging settings on most web hosts. While you may not see the errors on your WordPress site, they are still being tracked. The more errors, the more disk I/O, the slower the app.

During our 20+ years of software development, we have also found that leaving "innocuous" warnings in place tends to lead to trouble further down the road. Warnings today often become errors tomorrow. Many programming languages, PHP included, continue to tighten security and close loopholes that are typically found living near all those warning messages. Some warnings are also telling you to "change this now, it will be gone tomorrow". Eventually tomorrow will come.

While our plugins may not be the prettiest on the block, we do try to make sure that all the hidden stuff you don't see is designed as well as it can be. To sum it all up, we like to write plugins that last. We hope you appreciate our work.
